            <img src="assets/images/monstera1.jpg" alt="monstera plant with a new leaf"></a>
            <p>The Monstera Deliciosa is a relatively easy plant for beginners to take care of as it is quite sturdy and
                does not require much for it to survive. However, if you want it to thrive there are some things to
                think about
                that will make your plant grow big and fast. </p>

            <h3 class="care-image">Variegated Monstera Deliciosas</h3>
            <img src="assets/images/variegata1.jpg" alt="monstera variegata leaf with hand behind">
            <p>The Monstera Deliciosa Albo Varigate is a type of monstera that is not usually recomended for beginners
                as it can
                be expensive to buy and hard to keep beautiful. It differes from the monstera above in the way that it has
                white or yellow sections, which is
                caused by a cell mutation that removes the chlorophyll of the plant. These sections can result in a
                variety of patterns such as splotches,
                stripes, dots, blocks and even entire leaves. The lack of chlorophyll in the leaves are what make them difficult as they need 
                extra care in order to not turn brown and die. It is however inevitable that these sections die eventually due to this mutation, but with the 
                right care one can keep them stunning much longer than without it. </p>

            <h3 class="care-image">Coleus</h3>
            <img src="assets/images/coleus1.jpg" alt="bright pink coleus">
            <p>The Coleus plant has become very popular the last couple of years do to their wide variety in colors,
                leaf shapes and sizes. It can definitely be considered a beginner plant as it is generally easy to take care of. There are
                however som beginner mistakes that can really hinder them from showing off their true beauty.
