                <p>The Monstera Deliciosa is a tropical yet relatively easy plant for beginners to take care of as it is
                    quite sturdy and
                    does not require much for it to survive, even in not so tropical places. However, if you want it to
                    thrive there are some things to
                    think about that will make your plant grow big.</p>

            <div class="text-right">
                <p>The Monstera Deliciosa Albo Varigate is a type of monstera that is not usually recomended for
                    beginners
                    as it can
                    be expensive to buy and difficult to keep beautiful. It differs from the monstera above in the way
                    that
                    it has
                    white or yellow sections, which is
                    caused by a cell mutation that removes the chlorophyll of the plant. These sections can result in a
                    variety of patterns such as splotches,
                    stripes, dots, blocks and even entire leaves. The lack of chlorophyll in the leaves are what make
                    them
                    difficult as they need
                    extra care in order to not turn brown and die. It is however inevitable that these sections die
                    eventually due to this mutation, but with the
                    right care one can keep them stunning much longer than without it. </p>

                <p>The Coleus plant has become very popular the last couple of years do to their wide variety in colors,
                    leaf shapes and sizes. It can definitely be considered a beginner plant as it is generally easy to
                    take
                    care of. There are
                    however som beginner mistakes that can really hinder them from showing off their true beauty.
