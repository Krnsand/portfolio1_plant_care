            <p>There are different kinds of Monstera Deliciosas, widely categorized as <em>small form</em> and <em>large form</em>. The small form can be 
                recognised by the more oval shape of their leaves, while the large form generally have larger and more rounder leaves. The small form 
            can however produce quite large leaves as well the older they get and with the right care. So what is the right care? They want a lot of light but can be sesitive 
            to direct sunlight, so one might need to test how sensitive one own plant is. </p>

        <div class="care-image">

            <p>
                If placed in a spot with much light, let's say by a highly sunlit window, one can usually see it sprouting new leaves quicker than if it was placed further in the room.
                If your only goal is to have a beautiful green plant, then one can place it wherever it seems fit. They manage just fine with moderate lighting. 
                They do however require light, so don't place them in a very dark room. But if one wants a big and eye-cathing plant, then a highly lit area is the way to go! 
                Another reason why monsteras are very popular plants is that they are easy to water. They require a lot of water, but not too often. One should always let the soil dry up between 
                watering sessions which, depending on the amount of light they get, can vary from once to twice a month. 
                The older monsteras get the more "ribs" and holes do the leaves get making them look very tropical and wild. A young plant tend to have more whole and heartshaped leaves,
                but they too will get their signature shape quite quickly if given the prefered care.
