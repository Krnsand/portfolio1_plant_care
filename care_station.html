        <h2 id="monstera-care">Monstera Deliciosa</h2>

        <div class="care-image">
            <img src="assets/images/monstera_care1.jpg" alt="big monstera leaves with light shining on them">
            <p>There are different kinds of Monstera Deliciosas, loosely categorized as <em>small form</em> and <em>large
                form</em>. The small form can be
            recognised by the more oval shape of their leaves, while the large form generally have larger and more
            rounder leaves. The small form
            can however produce quite large leaves as well the older they get and with the right care. So what is
            the right care? They want a lot of light but can also be sensitive
            to direct sunlight, so one might need to test how sensitive ones own plant is. The best placement is therefore 
            in indirect sunlight to maximize light, but at the same time avoid burnt leaves.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="care-image">
            <img src="assets/images/monstera_care2.jpg" alt="a monstera plant in a sunlit window sil">
            <p>If placed in a spot with much light, let's say by a highly sunlit window, one can usually see it
               sprouting new leaves quicker than if it was placed further in the room.
               If your only goal is to have a beautiful green plant, then one can place it wherever it seems fit. They
               manage just fine with moderate lighting
               (they do however require light, so don't place them in a very dark room). But if one wants a big and
               eye-catching plant, then a highly lit area is the way to go!
               Another reason why monsteras are very popular plants is that they are easy to water. They do require a
               lot of water, but not too often. One should always let the soil dry up between
               watering sessions which, depending on the amount of light they get, can vary from once to twice a month.
               The older monsteras get the more "ribs" and holes the leaves get, making them look very tropical and
               wild. A young plant tend to have more whole and heart shaped leaves,
               but they too will get their signature shape quite quickly if given the prefered care.
               As these are tropical plants they like high humidity. It is advised to spray the leaves with water
               regularly, alternatively invest in a humidifier as that would create a more “authentic” climate.

            <img src="assets/images/monstera_care3.jpg" alt="a monstera plant in a white pot">
            <p>If one wants to take a cutting from a monstera in order to produce a whole new plant, called propagation, one must 
                find the right space between the <em>nodes</em> to cut.
               One will find the node by looking at the stem of the monstera and locating the newest aerial root. These
               are the long roots growing along the stems that the plant use
               to grab on to trees in the wild. When the node has been located, one must cut underneath it in order to
               ensure that the new plant has a starting root. If just the leaf is cut off
               without a root and stem, it will not be able to grow.
               Place the newly cut cutting in a vase with water, making sure the root is submerged.
               After a couple of months, depending on what time of the year it is, one can plant the new monstera in
               nutrient poor soil at first and care for it the same way as the original plant. Once it has established itself 
               to the new environment one can start watering with nutrients. The reason to not add nutrients from the start is 
               that it can become too much for the new roots that they become overwhelmed and rot, which will kill the new plant.

        <!--variegated monstera care-->

        <h2 id="variegata-care">Variegated Monstera Deliciosas</h2>
        <div class="care-image">
            <img src="assets/images/variegata_care1.jpg"
                alt="three monstera deliciosa albo variegata plants climbing on moss poles">
            <p>The Variegated Monstera is another kind of monstera that comes from the one above originally. It differs from the “regular” monstera in the way
               that it has white or yellow sections, which is caused by a cell mutation that removes the chlorophyll of the plant.
               These sections can result in a variety of patterns such as splotches,
               stripes, dots, blocks and even entire leaves. The lack of chlorophyll in the leaves are what make
               them difficult as they need extra care in order to not turn brown and die very quickly. These plants are seldom selled in regular stores (sometimes by mistake 
               though if the variegation is so small that it could be mistaked as a "beauty mark") as they are technically 
               a "faulty" plant. This is what make them so expensive, the inbalance of the supply and demand. One usually buys just cuttings of 
               these plants by private individuals either in different Facebook groups or auctioning sites, also some online stores have started selling small 
               plants of these if one would like to aquire a somewhat unique plant for themselves.

        <div class="care-image">
            <img src="assets/images/variegata1.jpg"
                alt="monstera variegata plant from behind with a new leaf in the foreground">
            <p>The variegated monsteras can be tricky to care for as they seem to work against themselves. Due to it being a tropical 
                plant as well as it having less chlorophyll than a “regular” monstera, they require much light. But, the white parts of the 
                leaves are much more sensitive to direct light causing them to get burned more easily. So, although a plant with an 
                entirely white leaf might sound really cool, it can be a literal nightmare to care for. This is one of the reasons why it 
                is not recommended as a beginners plant as it can be a lot of money wasted down the drain if one does not know the proper care. 
                So what to do? It can be recommended to have a specific lamp for plants aimed at it as they will not burn the leaves, while simultaneously 
                providing sufficient lighting. Keeping the environment of the room at a higher humidity level is also a good idea. One can spray 
                the leaves with water using a regular spray bottle, but one has to be careful that water does not collect in the new leaf if one is growing 
                out, as this will cause it to rot before it even has a chance to grow. This is where the humidifier comes in. It will keep the air humid 
                without it being harmful to the plant.

            <img src="assets/images/variegata3.jpg" alt="two big variegated monstera leaves">
            <p>Unlike the “regular” monstera, where the large form and small form are both pretty common, it is very 
                difficult to attain a variegated monstera as a large form as they are even more rare. The small form variegated 
                monsteras can go for up to ﹩300 depending on the amount of variegation they have and how big the plant is, on 
                auction sites. The large form however can go for similar prices and even higher, for just a cutting. Some people 
                (maybe most people) will think this is ridiculous for “just a plant”, especially since it will almost certainly 
                not stay as beautiful forever. But for real plant enthusiasts and collectors, these plants are a dream plant or 
                even a necessity in their collections.

        <!--coleus care-->

        <h2 id="coleus-care">Coleus</h2>
        <div class="care-image">
            <img src="assets/images/coleus1.jpg" alt="bright pink coleus">
            <p>The fact that coleus plants have become such a popular plant in recent years has probably not gone 
                unnoticed. Their immense versatility and color changing qualities make them very collectable. If someone 
                only likes green plants, there are about 100 different green coleuses of different shades and patterns. 
                If someone likes bright pink there are even more different types. And the fact that one can cross pollinate 
                different kinds to create ones own personal mix, is just an amazing bonus. As a collector or hobbyist it is 
                easy to become slightly obsessed (talking from experience) with these plants.
                So what does one have to do to take care of these plants then? Don’t worry, keep reading and you will find out.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="care-image">
            <img src="assets/images/coleus_care2.jpg" alt="a close up of a red and green coleus">
            <p>As for watering and lighting when it comes to these plants, they are pretty easy. Keep them in a well 
                lit area, preferably without direct sunlight as they can get burnt leaves, and water them regularly with 
                nutrients. In the summer one can give nutrients with every watering, but in the winter one should keep 
                that to a minimum as it can be too much for the plants when they don’t get as much energy from the sun. 
                This however, is a general rule. Certain types of coleus might require much direct sunlight in order to 
                produce the most intense coloring it can, and therefore need much more water than another coleus with a 
                completely different coloring. This is where coleus plants can become a bit tricky, as one has to learn 
                how certain types of colored coleuses act under certain types of conditions. Even here certain plant 
                lights can be beneficial as most of them need much indirect light to stay pretty and also in order to not 
                reach for the light and become long and frail. So, the more light it gets the more big and bright it usually grows.
                Even these plants can benefit from a humidifier as it can make them dry out less quickly and therefore not need to be
                watered quite as often as otherwise. Coleuses are however a very grateful plant to keep as they will litterally slope down
                when it needs water, making them look like they are dying beyond help. But fret not, giving them plenty of water 
                when this happens will 9 out of 10 times perk them up again like nothing has happened. A bit dramatic one might think, 
                but oh well.
