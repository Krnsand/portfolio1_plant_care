        <div class="care-image">
            <img src="assets/images/monstera_care1.jpg" alt="big monstera leaves with light shining on them">
            <p>There are different kinds of Monstera Deliciosas, widely categorized as <em>small form</em> and <em>large
                    form</em>. The small form can be
                recognised by the more oval shape of their leaves, while the large form generally have larger and more
                rounder leaves. The small form
                can however produce quite large leaves as well the older they get and with the right care. So what is
                the right care? They want a lot of light but can be sesitive
                to direct sunlight, so one might need to test how sensitive one own plant is. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="care-image">
            <img src="assets/images/monstera_care2.jpg" alt="a monstera plant in a sunlit window sil">
            <p>
                If placed in a spot with much light, let's say by a highly sunlit window, one can usually see it
                sprouting new leaves quicker than if it was placed further in the room.
                If your only goal is to have a beautiful green plant, then one can place it wherever it seems fit. They
                manage just fine with moderate lighting.
                They do however require light, so don't place them in a very dark room. But if one wants a big and
                eye-cathing plant, then a highly lit area is the way to go!
                Another reason why monsteras are very popular plants is that they are easy to water. They do require a
                lot
                of water, but not too often. One should always let the soil dry up between
                watering sessions which, depending on the amount of light they get, can vary from once to twice a month.
                The older monsteras get the more "ribs" and holes do the leaves get, making them look very tropical and
                wild. A young plant tend to have more whole and heartshaped leaves,
                but they too will get their signature shape quite quickly if given the prefered care.
                As these are tropical plants they like high humidity. I is adviced to spray the leaves with water
                regularly,
                alternatively invest in a humidifyer as they would keep the climate around the plants in a more
                "autentic" way.

            <img src="assets/images/monstera_care3.jpg" alt="two monstera leaves in a clear vase in a window">
            <p>
                If one wants to take a cuttling from a monstera in order to produce a whole new plant, one must find the
                right space between <em>nodes</em>.
                One will find the node by looking at the stem of the monstera and locating the newest aerial root. These
                are the long roots growing along the stems that the plant use
                to grab on to trees in the wild. When the node has been located, one must cut underneath it in order to
                ensure that the new plant has a starting root. If just the leaf is cut off
                without a root and stem, it will not be able to grow.
                Place the newly cut cuttling in a vase with water, making sure the root is submerged.
                After a couple of months, depending on what time of the year it is, one can plant the new monstera in
                soil and care for it the same way as the orginal plant.
